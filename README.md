# stdlibext

An extension on the C's stdlib, with features of safe memory allocation, freeing memory of a stack by introducing a "Safe Main" proxy via a preprocessor macro. It also adds some of the CPP objects, with the option to keep them close to 'C' primitives for raw manipulation (I'm using the terms Safe and Unsafe from 'Rust').
